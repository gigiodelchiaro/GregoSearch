# GregoSearch

[Read this in Portuguese (pt-br)](docs/pt-br.md)

GregoSearch is a modern and powerful search interface for [GregoBase](http://gregobase.selapa.net), one of the largest databases of Gregorian chant scores.

The goal of this project is to offer an enhanced user experience when searching GregoBase's extensive collection, providing robust filters and a clean, reactive interface to help musicians, liturgists, scholars, and enthusiasts find and work with Gregorian chant scores efficiently.
